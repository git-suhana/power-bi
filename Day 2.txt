Got familiarized with the three views available in PowerBI such as Report view, Table view and Model view.

Report View:
Characteristics:
Visualization: This view is primarily focused on creating interactive and visually appealing reports using various charts, graphs, and other visual elements.
Interactivity: Users can interact with the visualizations, apply filters, drill down into data, and explore insights.
Layout: Allows for arranging visuals on the canvas, setting formatting options, and designing a cohesive report layout.
Significance:
Presentation: Report view is essential for creating and presenting data insights to end-users or stakeholders in a consumable and understandable format.
User Interaction: Enables users to interact with the data visually, facilitating better understanding and decision-making.

Table View:
Characteristics:
Tabular Data: This view displays the data in a table format, showing rows and columns of the dataset.
Data Transformation: Users can perform basic data cleaning, sorting, and filtering directly in the table view.
Significance:
Data Exploration: Table view is useful for a detailed exploration of the raw data, allowing users to identify patterns, errors, or anomalies.
Quick Analysis: Provides a quick overview of the dataset's structure and content before creating visualizations.

Model View:
Characteristics:
Data Relationships: Allows users to define and visualize relationships between different tables in the dataset.
Data Modeling: Enables the creation of calculated columns, measures, and hierarchies for more advanced data analysis.
Significance:
Data Modeling: Model view is crucial for building a solid foundation for data analysis by defining relationships and creating calculated elements.
Complex Analysis: Essential for users requiring more advanced data modeling and analysis capabilities, such as creating custom calculations.
